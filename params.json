  "body": "* Contact: James Saxon (jsaxon@uchicago.edu)\r\n* Discussion Board: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uchicago/fall2016/ppha30550) – please use!\r\n* Meeting Day/Time: Section 1, MW 9-10:20am; Section 2: MW 1:30-2:50\r\n* Office Hours: Friday afternoon, TBD.\r\n\r\n# Course Aims\r\nThe past five to ten years have witnessed an explosion in both the collection of ‘big data,’ and the sophistication and accessibility of the tools required to analyze that data. This has spurred government agencies and policy analysts to develop novel, data-driven approaches to policy creation and evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis is an introductory course in programming and data analysis for public policy students with no prior coding experience. It is for anyone who wants to gather, explore, and share quantitative data – or work with others who do. The course has three goals:\r\n\r\n1. Early on, students will learn to think algorithmically using self-contained problems in python.\r\n2. We will then cover tools and recipes for retrieving, cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data. This will include:\r\n     * The command line. It is the ‘standard’ interface to computers for programmers. We’ll cover how to navigate it and use its many tools.\r\n     * Coding in python: fundamentals of the language including types, control, functions and classes, input/output, complexity theory, debugging. Students will learn to turn a question into a python program.\r\n     * Fundamentals of data science libraries (toolkits) including pandas and geopandas, plotting with matplotlib and seaborn, and basic analysis with scikit-learn.\r\n     * Basics of relational databases – one of the most powerful ways of storing, accumulating, combining, and accessing data.\r\n     * Basic web development: simple websites and an introduction to dynamic sites.\r\n     * Creating datasets and accessing available data: scraping web data and using APIs.\r\n     * Geographic Information Systems (GIS): representing your data in beautiful maps.\r\n     * Large projects depend on many people working together on the same code. Version control (now git) makes this possible. Students will use it to submit all work, and to collaborate on several assignments.\r\n3. Ultimately, students should be comfortable applying skills for research at Harris and beyond, and confident independently exploring new packages for further projects. They should know enough to work with and direct engineers for the projects that they need, and they should understand the potential of such work.\r\n\r\nThroughout we’ll emphasize good practices for collaborative code development and strive to de- mystify computers, the internet, and open source software. Particularly after the first weeks, we’ll highlight how these skills apply to evaluating and improving policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Books and Resources\r\nOnline documentation ('docs') will provide the principal written resources for the class; sources are listed for each week.\r\nFor many code projects/'packages' and languages, these sources are literally _the_ standards that define how to use the products -- and unlike books will keep up with the packages as they evolve.\r\nLocating these sources and using them to identify the methods or recipes you need is an important skill in coding.\r\n\r\nThis said, several of the O'Reilly books are very good and also happen to be available electronically through the UC library:\r\n  [Think Python](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/9969856) (Allen Downey),\r\n  [Python for data analysis](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/9969841) (Wes McKinney), and the\r\n  [SQL cookbook](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/10176227) (Anthony Molinaro).\r\nSeeing the material multiple times will help -- so please use these resources!!\r\n\r\n# Assignments and Grading \r\n## Weekly assignments (70%)\r\nAssignments will be posted on the class GitHub site at least one week before they are due.\r\nI will de-weight the lowest grade by one half.\r\nThe first week's assignment will be graded only for completeness.\r\nEach subsequent assignment will be assessed on: \r\n* Correctness (60%): does it give the 'right' answer and behave 'correctly' (no crashing or hanging)?\r\n* Style (30%): is the code commented and organized in a reasonable way?  Is the output visually appealing and clear?  Do all plot axes have meaningful, readable labels with units?\r\n* Performance (10%): does it execute in a reasonable amount of time?\r\nSince the parts of an assignment may be cumulative, it is _strongly_ advised to review and start the assignments early, so you can get help through Piazza or at office hours if you get stuck.  Assignments will be collected through GitHub, so get a student account [here](https://education.github.com/pack).\r\n\r\nAn automatic script will collect work at 1:30am, Tuesday morning.\r\nSince we may review challenging parts of the homeworks in class on Wednesday, \r\n  late work will be penalized 20%; notify the instructor to 'pull' it when it is complete.  \r\n\r\n## Final Projects (30%) \r\nWorking in groups of two or three, students will create a small web application to interactively present data that they have gathered.\r\nStudents will choose a subject and propose the functionality to me in advance.\r\nThat proposal should specify both a 'baseline' functionality, and several extensions.\r\n(I will provide example proposals, and endeavor to keep the baseline projects 'fairly equal,' taking into account different group sizes.)\r\nThe grading rubric will be modified to benefit ambitious projects:\r\n* Scope (30%): how many of the extensions did the group complete?  How much does the application do?\r\n* Correctness (30%): is the baseline functionality fully delivered, bug-free?\r\n* Style (25%): are the front-end and code both manageable?\r\n* Performance (15%): is the site 'snappy?'\r\n\r\n# Where to Work / How to Compute\r\n\r\nPart of the overhead to doing computation is getting the software running.\r\nStudents are therefore encouraged to install the software required for the class on their personal laptops.\r\nThis will enable them to straightforwardly continue using the skills that they develop, when the quarter is over.\r\n\r\nPython will be the primary language of instruction for the course.\r\nThere are many ways of installing and running it, but I suggest\r\n  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\r\nA small program may be scaffolded up on many others, \r\n  and depend on their being in the correct place with the correct versions in order to function.\r\n(These are called _dependencies_.)\r\nFor moderately recent computers, Anaconda handles all of this.\r\nAnaconda installs to a single folder, so you can easily remove it at the end of the course, if so desired.\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about this, talk to me.\r\nIf we end up having any trouble with Anaconda, \r\n   I'll provide an Ubuntu Linux distribution through Docker.\r\n\r\n**Bring your laptop to every class** -- short demos will be an important part of the lectures.\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\n\r\n## Week 1: Welcome to the Course -- and to the Command line!\r\n\r\n### Welcome to the Course.
